Problem:
How to start the next queue?
Options 1:
Wait for the previous timeout

Options 2:
Calculate based on new field value of when it started.

Why options 2:
To not be dependent on the previous queue, for it to be cleaned up when it finishes, and to not create ricorsive loop that may cause memory leak.


Problem:
How to delete queues so the array won't grow infinitely?

Solution:
Add wrapper to the promises, to know when they're all resolved.
